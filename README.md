Kanban Project - POLA 6200

In order to sustain the rapid advancement of artifiical intelligence the energy sector is expected to sustain a 30% increase of demand from industrial and commercial sectors to maintain data centers and business operations. This project is uses exploratory data analysis to determine how much energy we will need to produce to sustain these prospects. Using data from the EIA I was able to find the direct use of industrial and commercial generation in the United States from 2016-2023 and use that data to visualize how much pressure this will put on our energy sector.
